## Inspiration
Personally, I love Hackathons. I love tackling a challenge faced by my community and solving. Unfortunately, I only know few places that keep updates information on upcoming hackathons and not all of them are as inclusive as I'd like them to be.

## What it does
Finds Hackathons in your area, that are inclusive to everyone (but a feature for certain groups will be added), with all the important details pertaining to the event and gives resources to help you begin thinking of ideas and learning basic CS concepts without much jumping around to page to page.

## How I built it
Using HTML, CSS. Was Planning to include PHP and JavaScript but I was finding out of time to get it all functional.

## Challenges I ran into
I had trouble trying to figure out APIs for the map feature, but I'm hoping to tackle that task soon. For now, a static image will take it's place and a list will appear of the locations instead.

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
Finding a problem and learning how to solve it - Hackathons should be easy to find for everyone no matter who they are.

## What I learned
I learned that nothing is made over night and if I want this to be made a reality, I would need help from others and take my time to perfect the page.

## What's next for Hack Inclusive
What's next is a mobile app for easy searching with Google maps with targeted areas of Hackathons and more mini games
